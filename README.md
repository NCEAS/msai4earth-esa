This repository gathers code for the joint project between NCEAS and Microsoft to develop a new approach Ecosystem assessment.


# Active projects:
**iceplant_detection**

This is a working repository for an NCEAS project that uses machine learning techniques to identify areas with ice plant (Carpobrotus edulis) along the Santa Barbara County coast. In this project we analyse aerial images collected by the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) from 2012 to 2020.

C. edulis is a succulent shrub native to coastal areas of South Africa, a region with a climate similar to that of coastal areas in California, where this plant has become an invasive species. At locations outside its native range  C. edulis competes directly with several native, threatened or endangered plant species for nutrients, water, light, and space [[1]](http://issg.org/database/species/impact_info.asp?si=1010&fr=1&sts=&lang=EN).
