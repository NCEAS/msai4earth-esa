    "# About\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook extracts spectral and date features of NAIP images at random points within polygons in the 'polygons_form_naip_images' folder. These polygons are known ice plant and non ice plant locations within a specific NAIP image. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the aoi and years are specified, the notebook samples first polygons labeled as ice plant locations and then polygons labeled as non-ice plant locations. Two methods for sampling polygons are implemented in the `extracting_points_from_polygons,` and both are used in this notebook. The first one, `naip_sample_proportion`, samples a fixed fraction of the points in each polygon. The second one, `naip_sample_sliding`, samples a fixed fraction of the points in each polygon up to a maximum number of points. Polygons vary greatly in size, so simply sampling a fraction of the points in each polygon would result in an over-sampling of bigger polygons (most often those corresponding to non-ice plant locations), which in turn would unbalance the training set towards one label. The parameters used in this notebook were determined to obtain a final training set with a 3:1 proportion of non-ice plant to ice plant points. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTEBOOK VARIABLES:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `aoi` (string): This is the area of interest from which the polygons we want to sample were collected. Must be one of the following: 'campus_lagoon','carpinteria','gaviota',or 'point_conception'. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `years` (array): can be any subset from [2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020], except if aoi = 'point_conception'. If aoi = 'point_conception' then 2016 should not be included since there are not points to NAIP images to sample from on that year. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `sample_fraction` (float in (0,1]): fraction of points to sample from each polygon\n",
    "\n",
    "- `max_sample` (int): maximum number of points to sample from a polygon\n",
    "\n",
    "**OUTPUT:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is a dataframe of points with the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- geometry: coordinates of point *p* in the NAIP image's CRS\n",
    "- naip_id: itemid of the NAIP from which *p* was sampled from\n",
    "- polygon_id: id of the polygon from which *p* was sampled from\n",
    "- iceplant: whether point *p* corresponds to a confirmed iceplant location or a confirmed non-iceplant location (0 = non-iceplant, 1 = iceplant)\n",
    "- r, g, b, nir: Red, Green, Blue and NIR bands values of NAIP scene with naip_id at at cooridnates of point *p*\n",
    "- year, month, day: year, month and day when the NAIP image was collected\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataframe is then saved in the 'temp' folder as a csv file."
