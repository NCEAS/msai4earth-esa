To run the trials in these notebooks you need to correctly import the following custom modules (or make a a copy of them within this folder):

- lidar_sampling_functions.py
location: iceplant_detection/data_sampling_workflow/

- iceplant_detection_functions_Copy1.py
location: iceplant_detection/

Alternatively, move the TRIALS_# file to the main project folder.
